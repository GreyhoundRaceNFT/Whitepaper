# Como usar la red Polygon

Si no estás familiarizado con la red Polygon sigue esta sencilla guia.



How to setupThe game requires users to have a **MetaMask** account to connect to the **Polygon** blockchain.

### Metamask Setup <a href="#metamask-setup" id="metamask-setup"></a>

> ​[ **MetaMask**](https://metamask.io) is a software cryptocurrency wallet used to interact with the Ethereum blockchain. It allows users to access their Ethereum wallet through a browser extension or mobile app, which can then be used to interact with decentralized applications

You will need to [download Metamask](https://metamask.io/download.html) and install it on your preferred browser. Then you'll need to create a **MetaMask** account._Remember to keep you password and Secret Backup Phrase safe._

### Polygon Setup <a href="#polygon-setup" id="polygon-setup"></a>

> ​[ **Polygon**](https://polygon.technology) is an Ethereum layer-2 protocol and framework for building interconnected blockchain ecosystems, launched in 2017. Polygon maintains the **$MATIC** ticker for its native utility token.

You'll need to connect your **MetaMask** account to the **Polygon** blockchain.To connect to the Polygon network you can follow the following article: [https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network-838058f6d844](https://medium.com/stakingbits/setting-up-metamask-for-polygon-matic-network-838058f6d844) Your Network configuration should look similar to the following:

### $MATIC <a href="#usdmatic" id="usdmatic"></a>

Before playing, you will also need to ensure that you have some $MATIC to fund your farm.You can buy **MATIC** tokens on a range of open exchanges. To use on the Polygon network, you will first need to transfer these tokens from the exchange (eg. [Binance](https://www.binance.com/en)) onto the Polygon network. The easiest way to achieve this is through Binance's recent [**Polygon Wallet Integration**](https://www.binance.com/en/support/announcement/4515e97c82d64189885da7cd7d606b86). Now you can directly withdraw to your Polygon address that was created above during MetaMask/Polygon setup. You can find this by going into the Withdraw section of **Binance**. Input your Address, select the network (MATIC) and the desired amount. WIthin a couple of minutes you'll be able to see the amount sent on your MetaMask account.

### $USDC <a href="#usdsff" id="usdsff"></a>

You can also add the **USDC** token to your MetaMask wallet to keep track of your earnings. To do that you will need to [add a custom token](https://medium.com/publicaio/how-to-add-a-custom-token-to-metamask-b24b090f1550) to your wallet and input the **USDC t**oken contract address.
